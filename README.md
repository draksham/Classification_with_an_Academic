# Classification with an Academic

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a classification model that achieved an accuracy of 83.415%. The project leverages machine learning techniques to classify data, demonstrating a high level of accuracy and robustness.


## Project Description
The aim of this project is to build a robust classification model that can accurately predict the target variable from a given dataset. The model utilizes various machine learning techniques and is evaluated on its performance to ensure reliability and accuracy.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize numerical features.
2. **Feature Scaling**: `RobustScaler` is used to scale the features to handle outliers effectively.
3. **Model Training**: A `CatBoostClassifier` is used for training the model with the following parameters:
    - Iterations: 464
    - Depth: 6
    - Learning Rate: 0.09895
    - L2 Leaf Regularization: 9.98596
    - Border Count: 37
    - Random Strength: 0.12604
    - Bagging Temperature: 0.0578
    - Early Stopping: 100 rounds
4. **Evaluation**: The model is evaluated on a test set, achieving an accuracy of 83.415%.

## Results
The classification model achieved an accuracy of 83.415% on the test dataset, indicating its effectiveness and reliability. The high accuracy demonstrates the model's ability to generalize well to unseen data.
